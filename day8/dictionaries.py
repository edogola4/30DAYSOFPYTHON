# Dictionaries
# Dictionaries are a collection of key-value pairs.
# Dictionaries are written with curly brackets, and have keys and values separated by colons.
# You can access values by referring to their key name, within square brackets.
# Dictionaries are changeable, and values can be of any data type.
# A dictionary is a collection which is ordered, changeable, and does not allow duplicates.
#A dictionary is a collection of unordered, modifiable(mutable) paired (key: value) data type
